website for OWDDM

I thought it could be a fun/interesting little project to build a little website for the OWDDM. We can invite everyone who attends to open pull requests. We can include a list of topics covered in previous meetups with links mentioned, maybe a page for profiles of attendees with links, and a map/info how to get there. Of course a lot of the above could be done via Facebook and the meetup.com page, but this would be more fun. maybe we could register a domain name for it too...
